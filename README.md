# Loan-Insigths
## Practical Exam: Loan Insights
<p>EasyLoan offers a wide range of loan services, including personal loans, car loans, and mortgages.</p>
<p>EasyLoan offers loans to clients from Canada, United Kingdom and United States.</p>
<p>The analytics team wants to report performance across different geographic areas. They aim to identify areas of strength and weakness for the business strategy team.</p>
<p>They need your help to ensure the data is accessible and reliable before they start reporting.</p>
<p>The data you need is in the database named <code>lending</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Database Schema</strong></p>

<h2 id="task1">Task 1</h2>
<p>The analytics team wants to use the <code>client</code> table to create a dashboard for client details. For them to proceed, they need to be sure the data is clean enough to use.</p>
<p>The <code>client</code> table below illustrates what the analytics team expects the data types and format to be.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Column Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>client_id</td>
<td>Unique integer (set by the database, canâ€™t take any other value)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>date_of_birth</td>
<td>Date of birth of the client, as a date  (format: YYYY-MM-DD)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>employment_status</td>
<td>Current employment status of the client, either employed or unemployed, as a lower case string</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>country</td>
<td>The country where the client resides, either USA, UK or CA, as an upper case string</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Write a query to ensure that the <code>client</code> table matches the description provided. Your query should not update the <code>client</code> table.</p>

        ELSE TO_DATE(date_of_birth, 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')
    END, 'YYYY-MM-DD') AS date_of_birth,
    CASE 
        WHEN LOWER(employment_status) SIMILAR TO 'employed|unemployed' THEN LOWER(employment_status)
        ELSE 'employed'
    END AS employment_status,
    UPPER(country) AS country

## Task 2
<p>You have been informed that there was a problem in the backend system as some of the <code>repayment_channel</code> values are missing. </p>
<p>The missing values are critical to the analysis so they need to be filled in before proceeding.</p>
<p>Luckily, they have discovered a pattern in the missing values:</p>
<ul>
<li>Repayment higher than 4000 dollars should be made via <code>bank account</code>.</li>
<li>Repayment lower than 1000 dollars should be made via <code>mail</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Return the corrected <code>repayment</code> table.</p>

## Task 3
<p>Starting on January 1st, 2022, all US clients started to use an online signing system.</p>
<p>The analytics team wants to analyze the loan portfolio for the US clients via the new online signing system.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_1748/img/lending_schema.png" alt="database schema"></p>
<p>Write a query that returns the data for the analytics team. Your output should include <code>client_id</code>,<code>contract_date</code>, <code>principal_amount</code> and <code>loan_type</code> columns.</p>

## Task 4
<p>The business strategy team is considering offering a more competitive rate to the US market. </p>
<p>The analytic team want to compare the average interest rates offered by the company for the same loan type in different countries to determine if there are significant differences.</p>
<p><img src="https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_1748/img/lending_schema.png" alt="database schema"></p>
<p>Write a query that returns the data for the analytics team. Your output should include <code>loan_type</code>, <code>country</code> and <code>avg_rate</code> columns.</p>
